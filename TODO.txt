TODO
====

In priority order:

- document the PDBxx commands in Ex mode.

- when switching from pdb to vimpdb, if the remote VIM is unavailable,
  log a message and keep pdb running.

- keep debugging state in vim to switch vimpdb back to pdb when closing vim.

- key bindings in vimpdb buffer.

and much more...
